# OLX Pakistan B2B Homepage Clone

This project is a practice exercise where I recreated the homepage of the Pakistan B2B section of the OLX website using HTML and CSS. The aim was to improve my skills in front-end development by duplicating the structure and design of a well-known website.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on replicating the layout, design elements, and overall appearance of the OLX Pakistan B2B homepage using:
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling and layout

No JavaScript or other backend technologies were used, as the purpose was purely front-end practice.

## Features

- Header and navigation bar similar to OLX
- Responsive design elements with media queries
- Product listings grid layout
- Footer section with additional links
